Final version of the AI algorithm:

Whenever there is a hit, we pick a random orientation (vertical or horizontal) and call linearbombardment method on the coordinates of
that cell with the picked direction.
linearbombardment: takes in x, y and direction. For example, if the orientation is vertical, go up bombarding all cells in a line until
you're at the edge of the map or there is a miss. When that happens, switch direction to the opposite (in this case, down) and move down
from that cell, bombarding all cells in a line until you're at the edge of the map or there is a miss. If no ships are destroyed after
both directions have been explored, switch orientation, and go through every visited cell, applying linearbombardment function to those
cells with switched orientation. If a ship was destroyed during a linear bombardment, compare length of the destroyed ship with length of
the linear bombardment. If the length matches, that's it. Else, take # of cells that correspond to the difference between length of linear
bombardment and length of sunk ship that are furthest away from the cell which actually sunk the ship, switch orientation and perform linear
bombardment on those cells with switched orientation.
