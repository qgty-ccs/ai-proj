The current version works with Python 2.7 32-bit and needs pygame library.

Install pygame:
$ pip install pygame

Run game:
	If 32-bit OS, simply
	$ python battleship_gui.py
	If 64-bit OS, please run it with 32-bit Python binary as pygame runtime is 32-bit by default.
	For example in Mac OS X:
	$ python2.7-32 battleship_gui.py

How to play:
Press any key to skip introduction animation. Click on left map to drop ships. When all 5 ships are dropped, click squares on right map to attack an enemy coordinate.
